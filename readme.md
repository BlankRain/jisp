This is the [documentation for the jisp language](http://jisp.io), hosted via Github Pages.

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to get the dependencies. You also need `gulp`, `browserify` and `watchify` installed globally with `npm install -g gulp browserify watchify`.

To start development, run:

    npm run dev-min

This will compile .jsx and .less files, and host a static server, recompiling and reloading the page on file changes.

You can contribute to this documentation by sending pull requests to the [gh-pages](https://github.com/Mitranim/jisp/tree/gh-pages) branch.
