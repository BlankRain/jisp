This is the [documentation for the jisp language](http://mitranim.github.io/jisp), hosted via Github Pages.

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to get the dependencies. You also need `gulp` installed globally with `npm install -g gulp`.

To compile Jade, Less, and jisp, and recompile on changes, run:

    gulp

To host the page locally on port 3400, run:

    npm start

Or specify port with `node-static`:

    node-static -p <port>
